# alexhaydock/nginx-libressl

This container builds the [latest stable Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/CHANGES) with the [latest LibreSSL release](https://www.libressl.org/). It was created to aid with the easy deployment of TLS 1.3 services at a time when most Linux distributions were not packaging a version of OpenSSL that could handle it.

This container is built automatically using GitLab CI and supports the `x86_64` and `aarch64` architectures.

This container builds Nginx with the following modules:
* [ngx_brotli](https://github.com/google/ngx_brotli.git)
* [ngx_headers_more](https://github.com/openresty/headers-more-nginx-module)
* [ngx_http2_geoip](https://github.com/leev/ngx_http_geoip2_module.git) (when built locally with appropriate `GeoIP.conf`)
* [ngx_subs_filter](https://github.com/yaoweibin/ngx_http_substitutions_filter_module.git)

There are versions of this container which build against:
* [BoringSSL](https://gitlab.com/alexhaydock/boringnginx)
* [LibreSSL](https://gitlab.com/alexhaydock/nginx-libressl) (this container)
* [OpenSSL](https://gitlab.com/alexhaydock/nginx-openssl)

### Quick test this container locally
Run this container as a quick test (it will listen on http://127.0.0.1 and you will see logs directly in the terminal when connections are made):
```
docker run --rm -it -p "127.0.0.1:80:80/tcp" registry.gitlab.com/alexhaydock/nginx-libressl:$(uname -m)
```

### Running with your own config file
Run this container as a daemon with your own config file:
```
docker run -d -p "80:80/tcp" -p "443:443/tcp" -v /path/to/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx.conf:ro registry.gitlab.com/alexhaydock/nginx-libressl:$(uname -m)
```

### Build This Container Locally
I cannot distribute the MaxMind GeoIP databases legally with this project, so if you want GeoIP features, you must build this container locally. Sign up for a free account with [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com) and follow the instructions to generate your own `GeoIP.conf` and place it in this directory.

Now run:
```
make geoip
```

Or you can build the regular container with just:
```
make build
```

### Running Without Root
You can lock down this container and run without root and dropping all capabilities by using the `--user` and `--cap-drop=ALL` arguments.

For this example to work, your config file should instruct Nginx to listen on port `8080` inside the container:
```
docker run --rm -it -p "80:8080/tcp" --user 6666 --cap-drop=ALL -v /path/to/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx.conf:ro registry.gitlab.com/alexhaydock/nginx-libressl:$(uname -m)
```

You will need to make sure that the UID you pick matches the one you have set as the `NGINX_ID` in the `Dockerfile`, and that any configs which you mount into the container are owned by this UID (it does not need to exist on the host system).

If you are running rootless like this, you will also want to ensure that the `nginx.conf` does not try to listen on any ports below `1000` (you can still listen on `:80` and `:443` externally since the Docker daemon runs as root and can handle this - Nginx does not need to).
